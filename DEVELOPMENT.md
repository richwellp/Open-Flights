# Development

## Week 1 Summary
* During week 1 our team worked on parsing the data files from OpenFlights to find the names of airports, their locations in latitude and longitude, and the direct routes between airports used by airlines. Our team also worked on the AirportMap class which would make use of our graph structure to implement a map of airports and the routes/connections between them. Looking back, this week could have been more productive, but we made significant progress even though we all had other important things on our to-do lists.

## Week 2 Summary
* As of week two, we added another functionality that will read through the vertices of the data file.
Also, we worked on making our algorithms work. Lastly, we worked on creating an executable program to generate our graphs.
